# Simulator
The main purpose of this module is to create a controlled sytem for creating proof of concepts.
## Assumptions of the simulator
* Controlling is done in predefined discrete timesteps, which is one minute
* The controller module provides the heating power for the next time step. This heating power is determined in [W].
* Temperatures are determined in [Â°C]

## Cost
Cost of the energy is often not constant(eg. daytime/nightime price). Further plan for improve this modul for reneweble energy flexiible pricing.


## House thermal model
This model is a very basic heating system model.
Assumptions:
* optimal heating
* only the outside temperature is used
